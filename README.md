# liri-node-app


LIRI is an application just like Apple's SIRI, but instead of a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition interface. It takes in parameters in a command line Node and gives back data to the user.

	  The commands that can be executed are:
		    Enter: movie-this with a movie name to get details about a movie from the OMDB movie api.
		    Enter: spotify-this-song with a song name to get details about a song from the Spotify api.
		    Enter: my-tweets to get details about your last 20 tweets for the Twitter api.
		    Enter: do-what-it-says if you are a gambler!  A command will be read from a file and executed
